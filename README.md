# Pipelined-MIPS-Processor
Created and assembled 5 different stages of a MIPS Processor into an overall functional microprocessor architecture. Outputs of each stage were captured in a register, which then fed them as the inputs for the following stage. Each register operated on a shared clock signal to maintain a pipelined operation.
